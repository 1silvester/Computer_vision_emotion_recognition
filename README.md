# Computer_vision_emotion_recognition
Disseration project, An application which predicts emotions using facial expression via a webcam. Deployed using Streamlit. 
Models trained with two different datasets Facial Emotion Recogntion 2013 and Happy house dataset. 
Both datasets can be found on Kaggle. 

## Abstract from the final paper. 

The global pandemic has brought about new challenges for many across the world. One of the most prevalent amongst workers who are now working from home is “Zoom Fatigue”. This project aims to address this problem, through the use of computer vision and deep learning. One of the key ways to detect if a human is fatigued or distressed is through facial expressions. The project trained a Convolutional neural network to recognise facial emotions. This model was deployed and utilised computer vision to make predictions in real time. A model that achieved 63% accuracy was deployed to make real time predictions.
